# LUG-Fetch

## About

- A fetch tool written in POSIX `sh` and `C++`

- Meant for use in [LUGOS](https://github.com/lugvitc/LUG_custom_distro) (A Bedrock-derived distro made by the Linux Club OS Team)

## C++

The shell is too slow for operations to display such a fetch program. Since this program will possibly be run on a user's terminal on startup, speed is crucial.  Additionally, optimizing shell scripts almost always leads to unreadable code, which makes it harder for people to contribute. Hence the rewrite in C++ is to be preferred. The shell version is still here to stay consistent to other fetch scripts using shell.

## Todo
`C++`:
- [ ] Fetch the info dynamically
- [ ] Configuration file
- [ ] Code cleanup

POSIX `sh`:
- [x] Colored output
- [ ] Fetch the info dynamically (most likely borrow the scraping script from an existing fetch program)
- [ ] Document the code
- [ ] Configuration file
- [ ] Optimize the script cause its relatively slow as of now

## Contributing

- Functionalize everything in a format like:
```shell
# Description of function
# (paramters, asd=default_value)
function_name() {
    ...
}
```
